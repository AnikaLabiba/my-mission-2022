            <p>
                My main mission in 2022 is to learn font-end development. So I'm trying to be fully focused on this.

            <p>
                After completing the course I'll try to get work in freelancing websites. Because in our country,we need
                more experience than the skill. All companies need at least 5 years experience in the age 23. As I'v
                some working knowledge in this sites it may help me to gain some experience.

            <p>Thinking positive is not the mission for this year. I would say this should be everyone's lifetime
                mission. Cause when we replace negative thoughts with the positive one, we start getting all
                positive
                results.
